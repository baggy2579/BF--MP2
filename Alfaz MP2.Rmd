# Load necessary libraries for data manipulation, forecasting, and plotting

# Load the insurance dataset from specified location
insurance <- read.csv("C:/Users/Alfaz Khan/OneDrive/Desktop/insurance.csv")
ins <- insurance

# 1. Create Time Series
# Turn the TV.advert column into a time series, starting in June 2002 with monthly data points.
# This will help us see changes in advertising spend over time.
ins_ts <- ts(ins$TV.advert, start = c(2002, 6), frequency = 12)
plot(ins_ts)

# Time Series Plot
# This plot provides an overview of the historical advertising spend. For a forecasting employee, this visualization is crucial for initial assessment:
# We look for any upward or downward trend, which indicates sustained growth or decline over time.
# Additionally, recurring patterns or cyclical behavior may suggest seasonality, informing model selection.
# Understanding these elements early helps decide whether models that account for trend or seasonality are necessary.


# 2. Verify How Much History to Include
# Using all available historical data ensures our analysis is based on the full range of past trends.
# More history means better context for forecasting.

# 3. Hypothesize if the Dataset has Trend, Seasonality, or Both
# Hypothesis: We expect to see both a trend (general direction) and seasonality (repeating patterns)
# because advertising budgets often follow a predictable pattern over time.

# 4. Verify using Acf
# An ACF (Auto-Correlation Function) plot helps confirm seasonality if there are repeated peaks in correlation at regular intervals.
Acf(ins_ts, main="ACF of Insurance Time Series")

# ACF Plot
# The Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) plot helps identify seasonality and autocorrelation, essential in forecasting.
# Peaks at regular intervals suggest a seasonal pattern; for instance, if spikes occur every 12 months, it signals annual seasonality.
# A gradual decline in correlation over lags points to a trend. This insight supports selecting models like Holt-Winters or STL that can handle seasonality and trend.
# For data with strong seasonality, models like seasonal ARIMA might be considered.


# 5. Verify using Decomposition
# Decomposition splits the data into three parts: trend (overall direction), seasonality (repeating patterns), and noise (random fluctuations).
# This allows us to visualize each component separately.
ins_decompose <- decompose(ins_ts)
plot(ins_decompose)

# Decomposition Plot
# Decomposition separates the series into trend, seasonal, and residual (random) components.
# The trend component is key for long-term direction, showing whether the data has consistent upward or downward movement.
# The seasonal component highlights any repeating patterns, providing insights into the cycle length and amplitude of seasonality.
# Residuals should ideally show no pattern, indicating that trend and seasonality have been well-extracted. Large residuals or non-random patterns could suggest additional unexplained factors.

# 6. Choose an Accuracy Measure
# RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is chosen as our accuracy measure.
# It shows how close the forecasted values are to actual values—lower RMSE means more accurate forecasts.

# 7. Create a Forecast Model for the Next 12 Months
# We create forecasts using several methods to compare their accuracy.
# Each model has its own way of projecting future values, which we will evaluate based on RMSE.


# Naive Forecasting
# Naive forecasting assumes the most recent value will repeat in the future. 
# Simple but can be useful for data without strong patterns.
ins_naive <- naive(ins_ts, h=12)
plot(ins_naive, main="Naive Forecasting")
naive_residue <- residuals(ins_naive)
plot(naive_residue, main="Naive Forecasting Residuals")
# Naive Forecast Plot
# Naive forecasting assumes that the last observed value repeats in the future, so the forecast appears as a flat line.
# This method is simple but often provides a good baseline comparison for other models.
# In data without trend or seasonality, Naive can be surprisingly effective. However, if trend or seasonality exists, Naive’s flat-line forecast will likely perform poorly, as it doesn’t account for these components.



# Moving Average Forecasting
# Moving average smooths out fluctuations by averaging recent values, useful for short-term forecasting.
ins_maf <- ma(ins_ts, order=12)
plot(ins_maf, main="Moving Average Forecasting")
maf_residue <- ins_ts - ins_maf
plot(maf_residue, main="Moving Average Forecasting Residuals")

# Moving Average Plot
# Moving Average smoothing helps reduce short-term fluctuations, making it easier to see the underlying trend.
# This model calculates an average over a specified window, so it captures stable central tendencies, especially useful in noisy data.



# Exponential Smoothing Forecasting
# Exponential smoothing gives more weight to recent data points, making it good for short-term forecasts.
ins_ses <- ses(ins_ts, h=12)
plot(ins_ses, main="Exponential Smoothing Forecasting")
ses_residual <- residuals(ins_ses)
plot(ses_residual, main="Exponential Smoothing Forecasting Residuals")

# Exponential Smoothing Forecast Plot
# Exponential Smoothing is valuable for short-term forecasts, as it assigns more weight to recent observations.
# This approach adapts quickly to changes, making it suitable when there’s a need to react to recent trends.
# However, if seasonality is present, this basic smoothing method might not capture it well. This method can be extended with Holt or Holt-Winters for data with trend and/or seasonality.



# Holt-Winters Forecasting
# Holt-Winters forecasting considers both trend and seasonality, making it suitable for data with both.
ins_hw <- hw(ins_ts)
plot(ins_hw, main="Holt-Winters Forecasting")
hw_residual <- residuals(ins_hw)
plot(hw_residual, main="Holt-Winters Forecasting Residuals")

# Holt-Winters Forecast Plot
# Holt-Winters forecasting considers both trend and seasonality, making it suitable for data that exhibits both characteristics.
# Seasonal peaks and troughs in the data should align well with the model’s forecast line, showing that it accurately tracks the cyclical pattern.
# Forecasting employees use Holt-Winters to model data where seasonal behavior is stable over time. It also offers flexibility for additive or multiplicative seasonality, adjusting to amplitude changes.



# Seasonal and Trend Decomposition Forecast (STL)
# STL decomposition separates trend, seasonality, and remainder, then uses these components to create a forecast.
stl_decomp <- stl(ins_ts, s.window = "periodic")
plot(stl_decomp)
stl_forecast <- forecast(stl_decomp, h=12)
plot(stl_forecast, main="STL Decomposition Forecast")

# STL Decomposition Forecast Plot
# STL decomposition (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) is robust and flexible, especially useful in handling complex seasonal patterns that vary over time.
# It separates the trend and seasonality components, which can then be projected individually. This method is less sensitive to outliers and can accommodate both additive and multiplicative seasonality.
# Forecasts generated from STL can adapt to seasonal changes more fluidly, giving nuanced insights for medium- to long-term planning in volatile data sets.



# Classical Decomposition Forecasting
# This method uses a classical decomposition of the data to forecast the trend component for 12 months.
trend_forecast <- forecast(ins_decompose$trend, h=12)
plot(trend_forecast, main="Classical Decomposition Forecast")

# Classical Decomposition Forecast Plot
# Classical decomposition splits the series into trend and seasonality. This method works well for data with fixed seasonal patterns.
# The forecast based on the trend component extends the trend line, assuming that trend behaviors observed will continue into the forecast horizon.
# While not as flexible as STL, classical decomposition is efficient and can serve as a reliable choice for data where the trend and seasonal cycles are well-defined and stable over time.



# 8. Show Model Rank with Accuracy Measures
# Here we calculate RMSE (our chosen accuracy measure) for each forecasting model.
# Lower RMSE values indicate better-performing models.

naive_acc <- accuracy(ins_naive)
naive_rmse <- naive_acc[,"RMSE"]

ses_acc <- accuracy(ins_ses)
ses_rmse <- ses_acc[,"RMSE"]

hw_forecast <- forecast(ins_hw, h = 12)
hw_acc <- accuracy(hw_forecast)
hw_rmse <- hw_acc[,"RMSE"]

maf_acc <- accuracy(maf_residue, ins_ts)  # Adjusted to calculate accuracy on moving average residues
maf_rmse <- maf_acc[,"RMSE"]

# Create a data frame to compare RMSE across models
rmse_values <- c(naive_rmse, ses_rmse, hw_rmse, maf_rmse)
model_names <- c("Naive", "Simple Exp Smoothing", "Holt-Winters", "Moving Average")

rmse_df <- data.frame(Model = model_names, RMSE = rmse_values)
print(rmse_df)

# Sort models by RMSE to see which performs best
rmse_df <- rmse_df[order(rmse_df$RMSE), ]

# Visualize RMSE values with a bar plot for easy comparison
barplot(rmse_df$RMSE,
        names.arg = rmse_df$Model,
        main = "RMSE of Forecasting Models",
        ylab = "RMSE",
        xlab = "Forecasting Models",
        cex.names = 0.8)

# RMSE Bar Plot
# This bar plot shows the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) values for each forecasting model, 
# with the lowest value indicating the most accurate model. Here, Holt-Winters has the lowest RMSE, 
# suggesting it best captures the patterns in our data, including both trend and seasonality.
# Based on this, Holt-Winters is chosen as the final model to forecast the next 12 months, as it aligns 
# closely with the historical data and provides the most reliable prediction.

# 10.Forecast for the Next 12 Months
# Generate a forecast using the Holt-Winters model, which is expected to capture both trend and seasonality.
# The forecast includes both point estimates and a range to convey potential variability over the forecast horizon.

# Generate Holt-Winters Forecast
final_forecast_hw <- forecast(ins_hw, h=12)
plot(final_forecast_hw, main="Final Holt-Winters 12-Month Forecast with Confidence Intervals")

# The Holt-Winters model captures both trend and seasonality, crucial in our data, as seen in decomposition and ACF analysis.
# It has the lowest RMSE, indicating high accuracy and close alignment with historical values.
# The forecast includes confidence intervals, providing a reliable range for future values.
# Together, these factors make Holt-Winters the most suitable choice for confident 12-month forecasting.
